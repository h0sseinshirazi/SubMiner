# Asset ownership and publishing record

This record identifies the artwork supplied by Hachidori's repository owner,
**bee-san**, for the extension, documentation and Chrome Web Store materials.
The source files below were supplied on **September 8, 2026**.

## Visual novel backgrounds

**Copyright © 2026 bee-san.** The owner explicitly stated “i own the copyright”
and directed Hachidori to use the image made at 6:29am, with that ownership
recorded for Chrome publishing. This is the owner's declaration and
authorization to include the artwork in Hachidori and its publishing materials.

- Original filename: `ChatGPT Image Sep 8, 2026, 06_29_20 AM.png`.
- Selected image time: **September 8, 2026, 06:29:20am**, Europe/London.
- Repository file: [`extension/assets/preview-background.webp`](../extension/assets/preview-background.webp).
- Supplied format and dimensions: PNG, **1672 × 941**, **2,154,041 bytes**.
- Supplied SHA-256: `84c3fd0ff5803596a5991b52a8ce2f3d2da5083393197112425f5f340bdca361`.
- Usage: first-run practice and the Design preview, plus screenshots of those
  surfaces in documentation and store materials.

The supplied artwork bakes its own illustrated dialogue panel into the bottom of
the frame; Hachidori never shows that panel, and places selectable Japanese text
over the live scene above it. This replaces the earlier GSM preview background in
the packaged extension.

The owner subsequently supplied the five additional scenes below and requested
their use alongside the original in first-run practice and the Design preview,
with a random starting scene and an arrow to cycle through them. This extends
the record to those owner-supplied files and their authorized use in Hachidori
and its publishing screenshots. Every supplied image is a **1672 × 941 PNG**.

## Packaged form of the backgrounds

The extension only ever displays the top **1672 × 672** of each frame, so that
crop is what Hachidori packages, encoded as WebP at quality 82: 970,930 bytes for
all six, where the PNGs cost 13,413,193.

All six supplied files stay retrievable from this repository's history at commit
`4abbcd3`, where their sizes and checksums are the ones recorded above. The PNGs
the WebP files replace were those same images after ImgBot's lossless
re-compression in `23f138c`, which is why the replaced bytes and checksums differ
from the supplied ones while every pixel still matched.

| Packaged file | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| `preview-background.webp` | 147,244 |
| `preview-background-2.webp` | 153,232 |
| `preview-background-3.webp` | 145,796 |
| `preview-background-4.webp` | 191,904 |
| `preview-background-5.webp` | 178,482 |

## Hachidori logo pack

The owner supplied `hachidori-logo-pack.zip` and requested its use for the README
and other Hachidori branding. Archive SHA-256:
`b34398f7eb27eb136247445b20a48d69606366c0f8e1f929280f670519228e21`.

The following files are copied unchanged from that pack:

| Project asset | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/assets/hachidori.png`](assets/hachidori.png) | Transparent 1024 × 1024 hummingbird mark in the README |
| [`docs/assets/hachidori-icon.svg`](assets/hachidori-icon.svg) | Original vector mark |
| [`docs/assets/hachidori-logo.svg`](assets/hachidori-logo.svg) | Stacked logo with outlined lettering |
| [`docs/assets/hachidori-wordmark.svg`](assets/hachidori-wordmark.svg) | Horizontal logo with outlined lettering |
| [`docs/assets/hachidori-app-icon.svg`](assets/hachidori-app-icon.svg) | App icon source |
| [`extension/icons/hachidori-16.png`](../extension/icons/hachidori-16.png), [`32`](../extension/icons/hachidori-32.png), [`48`](../extension/icons/hachidori-48.png), [`128`](../extension/icons/hachidori-128.png) | Supplied icon sizes used by Chrome and the Settings/startup headers |

The SVG lettering is outlined and needs no external font. The pack's README
describes these variants; it contains no separate license terms. This record
documents the owner's instruction to use the supplied branding for Hachidori.
